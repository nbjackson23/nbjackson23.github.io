The world of IT, has been always a subject I dared not to touch.  I always joked around with the IT team at my job whenever I encountered any laptop/system issues and said " I only know how to turn it on/off and check my emails, please kindly fix it."  They always smiled and said no problem.  I never really paid attention to the world of computers or the web as long as I was able to utilize it for my convenience, and at a push of a button there it was for my viewing pleasure.

I use the internet on a daily basis at my job, we have certain systems that are ran every single day which I navigate through with out even thinking where it comes from.  One day, I came across this video on social media and saw a very young female talking about coding.  First thing, that caught my attention was that she was a female in the world of tech! Not only that, she must of just graduated from high school, I was impressed of the things she had actually just learned in a very short period of time and was already succesful at finding employment.  The crazy thing about it is, that she was hired at the exact same company that I currently work at!  How could this be?  So I researched more into what coding actually was, then I looked at open positions at my company.  It dawned on me that there are better advancement oppurtunities at the place that I work in, the way I was going up the "corporate ladder" was very limited and slow.  I could see myself working for only a couple more years and then move on to other endeavours.  

This is the most exciting thing but at the same time its terrifying, not only because tech has been something I always handed someone else to do, now I'm going to be behind the scenes!  I'm excited to learn and get my brain gears going, more than likely I'll be asking tons of questions since this is a new world to me.  I have a degree in Health Science, bodily functions were my eveyday subjects, now I get to use other functions in the world of web development.  Very excited to be here!
